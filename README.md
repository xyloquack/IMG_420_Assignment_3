### Main Game ##
- For right now this is a small experience that proves the basics of a game like this.
- Boids are used as the main weapon in the game, which are fired out in swarms that charge up over time
  - This is an upgrade beyond the typical projectile mechanics because you both feel like you are commanding a flock of birds, but you also get to see them move in their organic way once you send them off to attack the enemy, which gives off a weird, but powerful feeling that you have as the player, not sure if the power itself is good or bad.
- There is one enemy with only one attack pattern right now, and the pattern feels good to fight against, allowing for the fight to feel dynamic, especially when fighting a couple at a time in a crowded room like the last area shows, giving the player the ability to improve and refine their movement and attacking which gives a good sense of reward once you do get it down.

### Controls ###
- A, D -> Moving left and right
- Shift -> Dash
- Spacebar -> Jump
- Left Click -> Fire

### Assets ###
All assets used in the game, including the audio, are of my own making, and I'm pretty proud of the way it ended up looking at the end of the day with the art style coming to fruition over time and several iterations throughout the project lifespan, and the current art style feels expandable and within reach for my art skills.

As for the audio, I have gotten better at making sound effects, but I am still nowhere near as good as I need to be to be satisfied, but I need to implement the sounds I have made, because otherwise progress will be stuck at a stand still, and I will never learn what is wrong and what I want to change if I never try.

### Future ###
I feel like I have a lot of potential, and I have worked on moving this project to be more modular, which can be seen in things like the AudioController, the Weapon system I made for the one weapon so far that lets you have a sort of inventory, the saving a loading system between scenes, and so on. I want to add the ability to switch between rooms with scenes and expand on the ideas that this game has, because it has a lot of potential and I am passionate that I can get this to somewhere even greater than it is now.
