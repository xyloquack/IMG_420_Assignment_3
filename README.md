## Bird of a Feather ##
### Main Game ##
- For right now this is a small and incomplete experience that proves the basics of a game like this
- Boids are used as the main weapon in the game, which are fired out in swarms that charge up over time
  - This is an upgrade beyond the typical projectile mechanics because you both feel like you are commanding a flock of crows, but you also get to see them move in their organic way once you send them off to attack the enemy, which gives off a weird, but powerful feeling that you have as the player, not sure if the power itself is good or bad.
- There is one enemy with only one attack pattern right now, but that can be expanded later
