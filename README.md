## Birds of a Feather ##
### Main Game ##
- For right now this is a small and incomplete experience that proves the basics of a game like this
- Boids are used as the main weapon in the game, which are fired out in swarms that charge up over time
  - This is an upgrade beyond the typical projectile mechanics because you both feel like you are commanding a flock of crows, but you also get to see them move in their organic way once you send them off to attack the enemy, which gives off a weird, but powerful feeling that you have as the player, not sure if the power itself is good or bad.
- There is one enemy with only one attack pattern right now, but that can be expanded later

### Controls ###
- A, D -> Moving left and right
- Shift -> Dash
- Spacebar -> Jump
- Left Click -> Fire
- Esc -> Pause

### Assets ###
All assets used in the game, including the audio, are of my own making, and I'm pretty proud of the way it ended up looking at the end of the day

### Future ###
I feel like I have a lot of potential, and I have worked on moving my project to be more modular, which can be seen in things like the AudioController, the Weapon system I made just for the one weapon so far that lets you have a sort of inventory, the saving a loading system between scenes, and so on. I wan't to add the ability to switch between rooms with scenes and expand on the ideas that this game has, because it feels like it has potential
